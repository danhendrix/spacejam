## Description

You have just arrived in Acadamia, the finest place for learning! At least, it was...

Acadamia's Hall of Higher Education was once famous for teaching all those who wished to be taught, but ever since the current Magetician took over... Well, not everyone has been allowed to enter the Hall. The Magetician believes only those who prove their worth first are allowed to continue learning, despite the many pleas from those all over Acadamia.

We have waited for a champion of knowledge to defeat The Magetician and show them that any and all should be allowed to
enter The Hall of Higher Education. Perhaps that champion... is you.

## How to Play

Use your arrow keys or the on screen arrow buttons to move around the world. When you arrive at a path to another area, simply move in the direction of the new area to enter it.

Use your Enter key or the on screen Enter button to interact with characters in the world. If a character asks a question for you to solve, type your answer in the box and press the Submit button or your Enter key.

By helping those in Acadamia, you will receive Report Cards. Collect 3 Report Cards and you shall be allowed into the Hall of Higher Education, and have a chance to defeat The Magetician.

## Features

-   Personalize the experience by entering your name and selecting an avatar
-   Can be played on a computer with a keyboard, or on a tablet or mobile device with on screen keys
-   Three different areas to test your maths knowledge, as well as a final boss to put that knowledge to an even greater test
